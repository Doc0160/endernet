beta7:
+ Add a proper localization system!
+ Add a Polish translation!
+ Allow you to change the chat message format completely. See chat.messageFormat and the EnderNet website for more details.
+ Add optional /me, /hug and /slap commands.
+ Add the ability to add custom (/hug-like) action commands! Fun!
* Fix compatibility with Bukkit plugins and other Forge mods for shouting. I think.

beta6:
+ Added an "all" permission if you want to be 200% sure all is allowed.
* Fixed global permissions. The mod should work properly now.
* Removed debug message spam.

beta5:
* Fixed a bug that caused chat crashing on non-test-environment SMP servers.

beta4:
+ EnderNet transmitters and receivers can now send redstone signals!
+ Added Ender Chat Boxes. They will print out all messages they receive, as well as have a say(...) command to be able to say things.
+ Added playerRadius! It's a custom chat-radius system, works essentially like the one in Essentials.
+ Added randomHTTPPort parameter for LAN users. See console output for port for now.
+ Added globalPermissions - global (including intra-server) permissions.

beta3:
+ Add Ender Modems! They are far cheaper CC-message-only transceivers.
+ Add BuildCraft pipe support for Receivers!
+ Add the ability to whitelist dimensions.
+ Add "registerURIHandler" (String: class name) to register an IURIHandler via IMC.
+ Add the "disableCraftingRecipes" config option.
+ Add "canReceive" and "canTransmit" functions, returning booleans, to CC API.
* Refactored IURIHandler to require far less boilerplate code.
* The energy slot now takes Ender Pearls and Eyes of Ender. (Still not implemented)

beta2:
+ Add "getID" to the ComputerCraft APIs, to get the ID of the current device.
+ Add "hasItem" and "canSendItem" to ComputerCraft Ender Transmitter API - that way you can automate item sending better.
+ Improve item duct (Thermal Expansion 3) compatibility - you don't need a chest as a buffer anymore!
* /enreload now properly recovers from failure to reload.
* Fix major implementation bugs in the sending method.
/ BETA2 CANNOT PROPERLY COMMUNICATE WITH ANY VERSION BEFORE BETA2! The reason for that is the major bugs in the item sending method mentioned above - the format of communication had to be changed. (This may happen any number of times until we move to rc1/0.2.0. But I will try to promise that it won't.)

beta1:
+ Add the ability to use EnderNet UIDs (/eninfo) for blacklisted items
+ Add the ability to use item blacklist as whitelist
+ Add the /enreload command to re-load the config file.

+ Add permission system for URIHandlers.
  / Specify in permissions: [...] in endernet-servers.json.
  / Supported permissions: "item", "message".
+ ComputerCraft API now gives name of the server the message was received from.
* The EnderNet HTTP accesses are now threaded. Far less crashes!

alpha10:
+ Add ComputerCraft API!

alpha9a:
* Fixed an NPE in particle spawning
* Fixed SMP bugs, making the mod function correctly on servers

alpha8:
+ Add "receiveFromDefinedOnly" config option. Setting it to true makes you only able to receive from defined servers.

+ Added heuristic-esque NBT tag detection.
  * This will work on custom books and enchanted items, so you don't need to register these.
* Fix NBT sending over servers.
