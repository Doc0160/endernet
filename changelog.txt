beta4:
+ EnderNet transmitters and receivers can now send redstone signals!
+ Added Ender Chat Boxes. They will print out all messages they receive, as well as have a say(...) command to be able to say things.

beta3:
+ Add Ender Modems! They are far cheaper CC-message-only transceivers.
+ Add BuildCraft pipe support for Receivers!
+ Add the ability to whitelist dimensions.
+ Add "registerURIHandler" (String: class name) to register an IURIHandler via IMC.
+ Add the "disableCraftingRecipes" config option.
+ Add "canReceive" and "canTransmit" functions, returning booleans, to CC API.
* Refactored IURIHandler to require far less boilerplate code.
* The energy slot now takes Ender Pearls and Eyes of Ender. (Still not implemented)

beta2:
+ Add "getID" to the ComputerCraft APIs, to get the ID of the current device.
+ Add "hasItem" and "canSendItem" to ComputerCraft Ender Transmitter API - that way you can automate item sending better.
+ Improve item duct (Thermal Expansion 3) compatibility - you don't need a chest as a buffer anymore!
* /enreload now properly recovers from failure to reload.
* Fix major implementation bugs in the sending method.
/ BETA2 CANNOT PROPERLY COMMUNICATE WITH ANY VERSION BEFORE BETA2! The reason for that is the major bugs in the item sending method mentioned above - the format of communication had to be changed. (This may happen any number of times until we move to rc1/0.2.0. But I will try to promise that it won't.)

beta1:
+ Add the ability to use EnderNet UIDs (/eninfo) for blacklisted items
+ Add the ability to use item blacklist as whitelist
+ Add the /enreload command to re-load the config file.
+ Add crafting recipes!

alpha12:
* Fix bug introduced by threading that caused serious item duplication.
* Fix it again!

alpha11:
+ Add support for blacklisting receivable item types in config.
+ Add permission system for URIHandlers.
  / Specify in permissions: [...] in endernet-servers.json.
  / Supported permissions: "item", "message".
+ ComputerCraft API now gives name of the server the message was received from.
* The EnderNet HTTP accesses are now threaded. Far less crashes!

alpha10:
+ Add ComputerCraft API!

alpha9a:
* Fixed an NPE in particle spawning
* Fixed SMP bugs, making the mod function correctly on servers

alpha8:
+ Add "receiveFromDefinedOnly" config option. Setting it to true makes you only able to receive from defined servers.
+ Add WAILA integration (shows ID of transmitter/receiver on hover).

alpha7 "The Aesthetics Update":
+ Transmitters now emit pretty particles on successful transmission!
+ Better textures for Transmitters and Receivers.

alpha6:
* Fixed a bug where receivers did not initialize upon world reload.
* Fixed putting a receiver next to a transmitter.

alpha5a:
* Server entries from the old config get autoimported to the new one now.

alpha5:
+ Changed config format to a more superior one.
  * Passwords and permissions are not yet implemented.
* Items now fall out of an Ender Transmitter on break.
* Fixed the Ender Transmitter GUI refreshing to work a /lot/ better.

alpha4:
+ Add support for OpenBlocks crayons/glasses and Thermal Expansion energy storage sending
+ Added heuristic-esque NBT tag detection.
  * This will work on custom books and enchanted items, so you don't need to register these.
* Fix NBT sending over servers.

alpha3:
+ Add /eninfo command for devs to get information on their blocks.
* Fix maps being sendable.

alpha2:
- Remove extra debug code that stopped EnderNet from launching.

alpha1:
/ First release.
